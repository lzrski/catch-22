# FlatIron Examples

In this folder there are three flatiron examples:

* Single File
* Views only app
* MVC Style

The single file, is full web app in one file, for simple one page apps.

The views only app is more like a Sinatra crud application.

The mvc style application demos how you might want to implement a larger flatiron application.  The creamer plugin implements options for specifying the views and controllers folder.  Then it automatically registers the views and controllers when the app is initialized.
