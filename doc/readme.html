<p>An online gallery of vicious circles.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>

<p>It's an experiment in programming and psychology. The app will let you:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>add a vicious circle that you know about (eg. you are in, you were in, somebody you know is in)</p></li>
<li><p>mark circles added by other people as concerning you as well</p></li>
<li><p>write about your solution to circle, which concerns you</p></li>
<li><p>mark solution added by someone else as the one that works for you, or</p></li>
<li><p>mark such solution as the one that you are going to try</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-for">What for?</h2>

<p>We want to let people share their experience about vicious circles that concerns them. Also we need to gather some data for the paper Aga is writing.</p>
