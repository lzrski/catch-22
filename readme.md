Catch-22
========

An online vicious circle gallery.

What is this?
-------------

It's an experiment in programming and psychology. The app will let you:

1. add a vicious circle that you know about (eg. you are in, you were in, somebody you know is in)

2. mark circles added by other people as concerning you too

3. write about your solution to this circle

4. mark solution as the one that works for you, or

5. mark solution as the one that you are going to try

What for?
---------

We want to let people share their experience about vicious circles that concerns them. Also we need to gather some data for the paper Aga is writing.
